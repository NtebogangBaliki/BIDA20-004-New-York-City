    <h2 style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 20px; "> Convenience <br>A steak dinner at midnight? An early morning manicure? I can get anything I want at almost any time in NYC. Within a five-block radius of my apartment, I can hit the grocery store, drug store, pet store, and wine shop in a single sweep. This convenient lifestyle is addictive. We New Yorkers get spoiled, and when we leave the city, we forget that the rest of the world lives differently and on a more normal schedule.

          <h2 style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 20px; ">  Inspiration<br>New York has a way of giving me a feeling that I can accomplish anything I set out to do. On an ordinary day when I step outside my apartment building, I might find inspiration in any place – on the street, in the subway, at a Broadway show or in a sidewalk café. A plethora of inspiring, smart, creative people dwell in the nooks and crannies of this city.
         </h2><br>
    <h2 style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 20px; ">Diversity<br>One of the city's greatest attributes is its diversity, and NYC is often thought of as America's melting pot. About 36 percent of New York's denizens hail from other countries, and you can hear as many as 800 languages spoken. I love how each person has his or her own New York Story, whether they're a native, an immigrant or a transplant.
        </h2>
          <h2 style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 20px; "> Energy<br>There's no other city on the planet with an energy that can compete with New York. The fast pace, the buzzing traffic, the hustle and bustle of the people, the 24-hour life, and the creative spirit make NYC one of the most vibrant places in the world.
