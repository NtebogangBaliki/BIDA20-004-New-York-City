    <h2 style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 20px; "> Brooklyn Bridge Opening<br>
        John Augustus Roebling began construction of the Brooklyn Bridge in 1869, until he became sick and passed the challenge to his son, Washington Roebling. Washington was physically injured shortly after in 1870, which left him watching construction from his window as his wife, Emily Warren Roebling, worked with both her husband and the bridge’s engineers. The bridge opened on May 24, 1883. To quell rumors of the bridge’s weaknesses, P.T. Barnum led 21 elephants across the bridge on May 30, 1883. The bridge was the largest suspension bridge at the time, and it continues to awe travelers and onlookers.</h2>
          <h2 style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 20px; "> Henry Hudson’s Expedition<br>
          Having worked for the Dutch and the English at different times, Henry Hudson explored North America with the hopes of finding a northwestern passageway that would lead to the Asia. After two attempts with the British, Hudson was commissioned by the Dutch East India Company. During this expedition in 1609, Hudson and his crew sailed to New York and up a river to present-day Albany. This river is now named after him: the Hudson River.</h2><br>
